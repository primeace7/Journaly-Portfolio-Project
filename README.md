# Journaly Portfolio Project
Journaly is a journaling web application built to help users mitigate mental health issues through Positive Affect Journaling (PAJ).

Positive affect journaling is a style that encourages the writer to focus only on the positive aspects of their lives, emotions or any other topic they
wish to write about. Although this project was created as a tool for PAJ, a user may also use it for any form of journaling they please.

## Why Jouornaly?
In 2018, a group of researchers at Pennsylvania State University published [a paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6305886/) on the effects of web-based PAJ on the mental state of general medical patients with anxiety symptoms. They found that: 

> "Patients evidenced moderate sustained adherence to Web-based intervention. PAJ was associated with decreased mental distress and increased well-being relative to baseline. PAJ was also associated with less depressive symptoms and anxiety after 1 month and greater resilience after the first and second month, relative to usual care."

The frontend of the project is still in development.
